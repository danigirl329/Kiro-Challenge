# Documentation-First Approach

## Always Check Documentation

When working with AWS services, libraries, or frameworks, **always check the official documentation first** before providing answers or implementing solutions.

## Available Documentation Tools

You have access to MCP servers that provide up-to-date documentation:

### AWS Documentation (aws-docs)
- Search AWS documentation for services, features, and best practices
- Get the latest information on AWS APIs and configurations
- Find troubleshooting guides and solutions

### AWS Frontend (aws-frontend)
- Get React and web application documentation
- Find UI component patterns and examples

### AWS CDK (aws-cdk)
- Access CDK construct documentation
- Find CDK patterns and best practices
- Get guidance on infrastructure as code

### Context7
- Access library documentation for popular packages
- Get up-to-date API references

### Fetch
- Retrieve content from URLs
- Access online documentation and resources

## When to Check Documentation

Check documentation when:

1. **Implementing new features** - Verify the correct API usage
2. **Troubleshooting errors** - Look for known issues and solutions
3. **Using unfamiliar services** - Understand capabilities and limitations
4. **Optimizing code** - Find best practices and recommendations
5. **Answering questions** - Provide accurate, current information
6. **Deploying infrastructure** - Verify configuration options

## How to Use Documentation Tools

### For AWS Services
```
Use the aws-docs MCP server to search for:
- Service capabilities and features
- API references and parameters
- Configuration options
- Best practices and patterns
- Troubleshooting guides
```

### For Code Libraries
```
Use Context7 to:
- Get API documentation for npm/pip packages
- Find usage examples
- Check supported versions and features
```

### For Web Resources
```
Use fetch to:
- Access GitHub documentation
- Read blog posts and tutorials
- Get information from official websites
```

## Documentation-First Workflow

1. **User asks a question** → Search relevant documentation first
2. **Implementing a feature** → Check API docs for correct usage
3. **Error occurs** → Look up error in documentation/troubleshooting guides
4. **Suggesting solutions** → Verify recommendations against official docs
5. **Providing examples** → Use patterns from official documentation

## Benefits

- **Accuracy**: Provide correct, up-to-date information
- **Best Practices**: Follow recommended patterns and approaches
- **Completeness**: Don't miss important configuration options or parameters
- **Troubleshooting**: Find known issues and official solutions
- **Learning**: Help users understand the "why" behind recommendations

## Important Notes

- Documentation is more reliable than general knowledge
- AWS services and libraries update frequently
- Official docs include important warnings and limitations
- Examples in documentation are tested and maintained
- Documentation often includes migration guides and breaking changes

## Example Usage

When a user asks: "How do I configure Lambda with DynamoDB?"

1. Search AWS documentation for Lambda + DynamoDB integration
2. Find official examples and best practices
3. Check for IAM permissions requirements
4. Look for common pitfalls and solutions
5. Provide answer based on official documentation
6. Include links to relevant documentation sections
